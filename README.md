👩‍💻 Passionate about solving complex problems through data-driven solutions. I'm a backend developer with experience in databases (MySQL, MongoDB), server management, and development with Java and Spring Boot.

📊 I spent eight years in digital marketing, leading teams and data-driven campaigns. This experience sharpened my analytical mindset, which I now apply to backend development, combining my deep understanding of data with the technical skills I gained from a Full Stack Development Bootcamp.

🌟 I’m always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow in tech, specifically in backend development, where I can create efficient, scalable, and data-driven solutions.
